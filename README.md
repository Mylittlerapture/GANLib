# GANLib

An attempt of creating easy-to-use GAN library on top of keras. Created rather for educational purposes and for personal usage.


Also going to dedicate this project as part of [#100DaysofMLCode](https://github.com/llSourcell/100_Days_of_ML_Code) challenge to get some additional motivation. Here will be the log of the progress: [100DMLCLog.md](100DMLCLog.md)

#### Installing:
WARNING! Keep in mind this is a very early stage of the project. Many things might not work as expected! (That said, feel free to open issue, ask a question or make any suggestions.)
```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Mylittlerapture/GANLib GANLib
cd GANLib
pip3 install -e .
```


#### Examples:
