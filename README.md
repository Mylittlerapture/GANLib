# GANLib

An attempt of crating easy-to-use GAN library on top of keras. Created rather for educational purposes and for personal usage.


Also going to dedicate this project as part of [#100DaysofMLCode](https://github.com/llSourcell/100_Days_of_ML_Code) challenge to get some additional motivation. Here will be the log of the progress: [100DMLCLog.md](100DMLCLog.md)
