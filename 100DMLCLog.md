# 100 Days Of ML - LOG

## Day 1 : July 7 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : Plotter updated, so now it plots all available history labels. Also diving into Progressive GAN so I can start to implement it as a next one.

## Day 2 : July 8 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : Start working on Progressive GAN implementation. For now I'm going to implement basic idea of growing layers. Other ideas from original paper will be added gradually.

## Day 3 : July 9 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : Progressive GAN is now growing during training. Not sure about overall structure though. Probably will change it later.
