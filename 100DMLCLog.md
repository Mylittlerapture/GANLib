# 100 Days Of ML - LOG

## Day 1 : July 7 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : Plotter updated, so now it plots all available history labels. Also diving into Progressive GAN so I can start to implement it as a next one.

## Day 2 : July 8 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : Start working on Progressive GAN implementation. For now I'm going to implement basic idea of growing layers. Other ideas from original paper will be added gradually.

## Day 3 : July 9 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : Progressive GAN is now growing during training. Not sure about overall structure though. Probably will change it later.

## Day 4 : July 10 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : Added template for Adversarial Autoencoder with little twist to it, trying to test some ideas.

## Day 5 : July 11 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : Today I experimented with domain to domain encoding, with a little bit of success. Because result code end up way different from AAE I split it to different class called DAAE (Domain based Adversarial Autoencoder)

## Day 5 : July 12 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : Cleaned up DAAE code and eventually improved results a lot by changing a way how discriminator work.
